Bonder is a program designed to identify, isolate and characterise non-covalent interactions based on the reduced electron density gradient. It separately investigates individual non-covalent interactions using a divide and conquer approach, which greatly reduces the computational costs and makes it trivial to calculate integrated properties for each interaction.

Bonder can either analyse a precomputed electron density in WFN or WFX format, or it can generate a simple promolecular electron density from atomic coordinates in XYZ format and then analyse this.
