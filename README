Bonder is a program designed to identify, isolate and characterise non-covalent interactions based on the reduced electron density gradient. It separately investigates individual non-covalent interactions using a divide and conquer approach, which greatly reduces the computational costs and makes it trivial to calculate integrated properties for each interaction.

Bonder can either analyse a precomputed electron density in WFN or WFX format, or it can analyse a simple promolecular electron density obtained from atomic coordinates in XYZ format.
